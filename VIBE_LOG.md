# Vibe Coding Log ⚡️

**Total Time Taken:** ~22 Minutes

## The Process

We built this portfolio with a focus on **speed**, **flexibility**, and **modern aesthetics**. Here's how we vibed:

### 1. The Setup (Speed Bumps & Workarounds)
- **Goal**: Quick start with Vite.
- **Reality**: Encountered some network hiccups with the CLI.
- **The Fix**: We didn't stop. We manually constructed the project structure, wrote the `package.json` from scratch, and wired up Vite manually. This gave us total control over the configuration.

### 2. The Architecture (Clean & Scalable)
- **React**: Chosen for its component-based power.
- **Vanilla CSS**: We kept it raw and fast. No heavy frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap.
- **CSS Variables**: Defined a design system in `src/styles/variables.css` first. This made theming (like dark mode support) and consistency effortless.
- **Lucide Icons**: Added for that crisp, professional visual touch.

### 3. The Flow (Component by Component)
We built from the outside in:
1.  **Core UI**: `Navbar` and `Footer` to frame the page.
2.  **Hero Section**: Big, bold text to grab attention immediately.
3.  **Content Sections**: `About`, `Projects`, and `Contact` were modularized for easy editing.
4.  **Data**: Extracted project data into `src/data` so you can update your portfolio without touching the React code.

### 4. The Result
A fully responsive, high-performance portfolio that is 100% yours. It's built to grow with you.
